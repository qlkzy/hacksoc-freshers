              <h2>What is HackSoc?</h2>
            </header>

            <p>HackSoc is the computer science society here at the
            University of York, although you don't need to be a
            computer science student to participate. We run a mixture
            of academic and social events, providing a way for people
            to learn about things they're interested in, which may not
            necessarily be covered by the actual course.</p>

            <p>Whilst plans for the next academic year are a bit hazy
            at the moment, we will be running an
            intermediate-level <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>
            course in the Spring term, and hope to run some
            introductory courses in the Autumn term.</p>

            <p>You can find more information on our
            website, <a href="http://www.hacksoc.org">hacksoc.org</a>.</p>

            <header>
              <h2>What events do you run?</h2>
            </header>

            <p>We run a mixture of academic and social events. Our
            academic events consist of lectures and seminars, which
            anyone can ask to run. We try to run one or two courses
            each term as well. Our staple social events are boardgames
            evenings and visiting pubs, although we're considering
            branching out.</p>

            <p>We're also looking into the possibility of guest
            lectures and trips for next year, although currently these
            are very provisional.</p>

          <section id="what-should-i-bring">
            <header>
              <h2>What should I bring?</h2>
            </header>

            <p>YUSU provide
            a <a href="http://www.yusu.org/docs/Freshers-Checklist.pdf">checklist
            of things to bring</a>, so we shall only include the more
            essential things here:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Government-issued photographic ID (if you have some)</li>
              <li>Spare passport photos</li>
              <li>For international students: visa and any documentation</li>
              <li>Clothes</li>
              <li>Towels</li>
              <li>Toiletries</li>
              <li>Duvet</li>
              <li>Pillows</li>
              <li>Bed sheets</li>
              <li>Cutlery</li>
              <li>Crockery</li>
              <li>Pots and pans</li>
              <li>Cooking utensils</li>
              <li>Cleaning materials</li>
              <li>Enough food to survive for a few days</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The kitchens do get cleaned once a week, but you are
            expected to keep it clean for the majority of the time,
            and having your kitchen be consistently messy can get you
            a fine!</p>

            <p>There is no need to bring food with you, as there are
            many places fairly nearby (the Morrisons is a favourite
            spot for students), so you can always go out and get some
            after unpacking the rest of your stuff. Many flats all
            pool together and get shopping delivered, so if you don't
            feel like trekking to the shops every fortnight or so,
            perhaps talk to your flatmates about that.</p>

            <p>If you're in catered accommodation, you can get some
            general information about
            that <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/commercialservices/catering_and_bars/catered_accomodation/index.html">on
            the Commercial Services website</a>, or directly look
            up <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/commercialservices/catering_and_bars/index.html">the
            catering outlets</a>.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="what-do-i-do-on-moving-in-day">
            <header>
              <h2>What do I do on moving in day?</h2>
            </header>

            <p>Firstly, make sure you know which car park is closest
            to your college, as carrying your stuff all over the place
            is not fun. There are lots of car parks, so you should be
            able to find one fairly close to your new home. Once you
            arrive, there should be a plethora of helpers wandering
            around, guiding people to and fro, and helping people
            transport their things. You'll want to go get your keys
            and university card, and someone will probably grab you
            and take you to where that's happening as soon as you get
            out of the car.</p>

            <p>Once you have your keys, go find your room and proceed
            to move things over there. Again, there will be people to
            help you if you get lost, so don't be afraid to
            ask. Furthermore, there are trolleys (£10 deposit
            required), so if you're lucky you might be able to get one
            before they are all gone.</p>

            <p>Leave your door open, and go introduce yourself to your
            flatmates. Remember: they're just as confused as you
            are. Later in the day, your STYCs (Second and Third Year
            Contacts) will arrive, these are two people who are
            assigned to look after your flat for freshers' week, and
            are typically very nice people. Their job is to answer any
            questions you might have, so ask away.</p>

            <p>To finish the day, there will be some sort of college
            welcome event, which your STYCs will take you to.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="who-will-look-after-me">
            <header>
              <h2>Who will look after me?</h2>
            </header>

            <p>Fortunately, the university and YUSU are rather used to
            people being lost when they arrive, and so provide many
            points of contact if you need help.</p>

            <p>During freshers week you will have two STYCs (Second
            and Third Year Contacts), whose job is to provide any help
            you need during that week. You will also be assigned a
            supervisor, an academic in your department who will look
            after you for all of your time at York. Finally, your
            college will have a welfare team, YUSU has a welfare team,
            and there are other societies like Nightline who also
            provide support.</p>

            <p>We all know that starting a totally new life can be
            scary and confusing, so if you need any help at all, don't
            be afraid to ask anyone. Even if they can't solve your
            problem, they should be able to point you to someone who
            can.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="what-are-the-colleges">
            <header>
              <h2>What are the colleges?</h2>
            </header>

            <p>For organisational purposes, the university is divided
            into a number of undergraduate colleges, and one
            postgraduate college (Wentworth). However, unlike many
            universities, which college you end up in isn't terribly
            important. You will be a member of a college for your time
            at York, and the major thing this affects is where you
            live in your first year. Colleges do run events such as
            film nights, trips, toasties, and so on, but in general,
            anyone from any college can turn up to any event.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="where-should-i-live">
            <header>
              <h2>How do I apply for accommodation, and where should I live?</h2>
            </header>

            <p>Once you have accepted an unconditional offer (that is,
            you have your results and confirmed that York is where
            you'll be going), you will receive an email giving you
            access to the online application system for
            accommodation. On results day, the emails are sent out over
            a 48 hour period randomly, so you may not get yours until
            the next day, but don't worry. Once you make your
            application, you'll receive a room offer within three
            days, after which you must pay a deposit to confirm it. If
            you don't confirm within a few days, your offer will be
            withdrawn, and you'll have to apply again.</p>

            <p>Which college you apply to depends mostly on what
            you'll be studying, and what you want. Some colleges offer
            en-suite rooms, some offer catering, some are on the main
            campus, some are on the Heslington East campus. Hes East
            houses Goodricke and Langwith colleges, and also the
            departments of Computer Science; Theatre, Film, and
            Television; and Law and Management.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="where-are-things-on-campus">
            <header>
              <h2>Where are things on campus?</h2>
            </header>

            <p>There are two (well, three) campuses at York. The main
            campus, also known as Heslington West, the Heslington East
            campus, and King's Manor, which is sometimes used by the
            Archaeology and History departments. The two Heslington
            campuses are about ten minutes apart by foot, and there
            are free buses between them.</p>

            <p>Most things are on the main campus, and Hes East has
            Goodricke and Langwith colleges; the departments of
            Computer Science, Theatre Film and Television, Law and
            Management; and the Langwith bar, The Glasshouse. There
            are two Costcutters on campus, one in Market Square (next
            to Vanbrugh College) and one at Halifax College. The
            university library is also next to both Alcuin and
            Vanbrugh colleges.</p>

            <p>You can find
            a <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/about/maps/campus/">campus
            map</a> on the university website, and you shall
            doubtlessly be provided with one shortly after you

              <h2>Where are things in York?</h2>
            </header>

            <p>The university itself is situated in Heslington, a
            village on the outskirts of York. Heslington features a
            post office, a Co-operative, and a few pubs. The city
            centre itself is about a 40 to 50 minute walk from main
            campus, and on the way is the Foss Islands Retail Park,
            which has a Morrisons and a few other shops.</p>

              <h2>What is YUSU?</h2>
            </header>

            <p><a href="http://www.yusu.org/">YUSU</a> is the
            University of York Students' Union, and is responsible for
            representing students in the university as a whole, for
            managing the societies, sports clubs, and also run two of
            the campus bars. For most students, YUSU is perhaps a
            mysterious organisation often spoken of, but that doesn't
            really seem to affect them directly, but if you get
            involved with societies, welfare, representation, or the
            like, you will quickly learn how much YUSU does.</p>

            <p>Basically, if you have any problems during your time as
            a student at York, YUSU can help you.</p>

          <section id="what-are-societies">
            <header>
              <h2>What are societies and clubs?</h2>
            </header>

            <p>Societies are student-run organisations which are a
            part of YUSU. There
            are <a href="http://www.yusu.org/activities/societies">many
            societies</a>, catering to most interests. Many societies
            charge a membership fee, but this is typically a low
            amount, like £4. HackSoc does not charge a membership fee
            currently. Any student can join any society, so don't be
            afraid to just turn up to something and try it out, most
            don't worry about membership fees for people just having a
            look.</p>

            <p>Clubs are like societies, but are for
            sports. Again, <a href="http://www.yusu.org/sport/clubs">there
            are a lot of clubs</a>, and you can try any of them
            out. Club membership fees tend to be a bit higher than for
            societies, and also may have per-session fees, but this is
            because most clubs bring in a trained instructor to run
            sessions.</p>

            <p>In the Freshers' Fair at the end of freshers' week, all
            societies and clubs have the opportunity to run a stall
            and advertise themselves, so you will have plenty of
            opportunity to learn about ones which may interest
            you. Try out as many as you can!</p>
